 Biometric Security System 🔐
Overview
This project is a Biometric Security System that enhances access control using fingerprint authentication. It integrates biometric sensors with Arduino/ESP32 to verify identities and grant access securely.

Features
✅ Fingerprint Authentication – Uses a fingerprint sensor for secure access control.
✅ Real-time Verification – Authenticates users instantly.
✅ Secure Data Storage – Stores fingerprints safely in EEPROM or a database.
✅ IoT Integration (Optional) – Can be connected to the cloud for remote monitoring.
✅ User Management – Add or remove authorized users dynamically.

Hardware Used
Microcontroller: Arduino Uno / ESP32
Fingerprint Sensor: R307 / GT-511C3
Display: OLED / LCD (Optional)
Relay Module: For controlling doors/locks
Buzzer & LED: For status indication
Software & Libraries
